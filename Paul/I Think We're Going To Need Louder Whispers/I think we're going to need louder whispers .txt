Moore street is one of the oldest outdoor markets in Ireland. For years its traders have been resisting property speculators efforts to ‘develop’ the street.    Behind the fruit and veg stalls are other points of resistance.  The mobile phone repairs shops are integrated into an alternative, networked global economy of components,consignments and containers. In contrast to the homogenous and banal consumer tech stores that push the illusory promise of the eternal upgrade, the shops on Moore street foster a culture of reuse and care. 

Stephen Graham & Nigel Swift describe repair and maintenance as vital everyday acts that ‘whisper the world into existence’.I think we’re going to need louder whispers. ——————————————
