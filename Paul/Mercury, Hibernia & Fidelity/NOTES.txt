The images + Gifs folder has two gifs 

1.gif is a series of glitches of an image from an anti-vax protest outside the GPO - the original source image is not mine and I have not included it. 

And I have purposely kept it as vague as possible. 

2.gif - the first gif was glitched using text/ASCII approach - I corrupted the original file by putting passages from the proclamation into the image file. This gif is a series of screengrabs of this process - it runs through the whole proclamation. 


I have also included the stills from 1.gif in case you’d prefer to use them. 

Whatever suits! 

I’m happy to not reveal the process - vague works for me here.
