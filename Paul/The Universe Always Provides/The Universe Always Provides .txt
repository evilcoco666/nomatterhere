Eircom payphones are being removed. 

In 2010, there were over 3,500 pay phones in Ireland. 

Now there are less than 50.  

The Commission for Communications Regulation (COMREG)removed the requirement for a  Universal Service Provider.   

The needs of public payphone users will be met private companies.  

If a phone is used for less than a minute a day on average, it gets removed. 

They are being replaced by wi-fi kiosks. 

These kiosk will be operated by a media branding company.
