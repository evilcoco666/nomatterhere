Users are encouraged to unearth mysterious pages, hyperlinks, images, videos and electronic ephemera.&nbsp;</p>
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">Departing from a film by Frank Sweeney which explores the privatisation of Telecom Éireann from the viewpoint of shareholders communicating on early online forums; Rachel O&rsquo;Dwyer examines how early radio technologies and their communities manifest another vision of the internet; Eva George Richardson McCrea brings together a wide range of material in a film which considers relationships between technology, vision, science, myth, and systems of belief; Paul O&rsquo;Neill pulls dead IP address, analysing these network topologies to reveal traces of infrastructures past and obsolete; while Roo Honeychild takes a focused dive into the deep past of ledger, record keeping and authentication technologies and their role in social processes such as state formation and deformation.&nbsp;</p>
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">These five works are exhibited in a series of webpages, designed using the tools/aesthetics of web 1.0 designed by Coilin O&rsquo;Connell aka BrassNeck Press. Specific digital imagery has been commissioned for the web zine. The graphics, by artists Michelle Doyle, Gary Merrin, Anthony O&rsquo;Conner and Aoife O&rsquo;Toole will be embedded in the website and dispersed across social media and the world wide web.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">no_matter_here is presented as part of Brightening Air | Coiscéim Coiligh, a nationwide, ten day season of arts experiences brought to you by the Arts Council.&nbsp;</p>        <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-ec371b51-7fff-4dd3-6986-a4d15aee1404">&nbsp;</p></td>
