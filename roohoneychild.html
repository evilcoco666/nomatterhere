<p>Radical theory, from at least the time of the enlightenment, and
maturing in the age of Marx and Engels, has been veritably obsessed with a
notion of linear history and progress. The general idea is that if one can learn
something of the general rules of history, assuming that history has rules, then
one can make predictions about the future. This is an idea with some clear
validity, as an understanding of the past surely influences and directs our
actions in the present, thereby creating futures.</p>
<p>Technology is another great preoccupation of many radical theorists
and bears a close relationship with notions of linear progress and the rules of
history. It’s extremely easy to imagine the development of technology as a
linear force unto itself, given its position of gargantuan fetishism within our
society and culture. It is very obvious to the so-called modern person that the
horse and cart of one hundred years ago is inferior to the BMW of today. By
free association, the modern person then concludes that the one who rode the

horse and cart to market lacked the modern sensibility, intelligence and
progressive virtues of the one who drives the BMW to the office.</p>
<p>This is, of course, nonsense. By all scientific measures the modern
person is, in no qualitative or important sense, different to the person who
lacked the convenience of the combustion engine or the protection of
antibiotics. The so-called modern human had acquired most of their essential
features by 300,000 years ago, according to recent discoveries at Jebel
Irhoud, and there has been no statistically significant advancement in human
cognitive capabilities for, at least, 60,000 years. In fact our brains have gotten
smaller in the last 12-15,000 years, although whether or not that is indicative
of any effect on intelligence is controversial.</p>
<p>I find it extremely interesting to consider the way that innovations in
technology shape our cultural perceptions of history, society, and ourselves.
This is an unmistakable pattern in the general contours of social and cultural
history, from prehistory down to today. Emerging elites have often identified
themselves with power through association with new technologies, a
phenomenon increasingly prevalent in contemporary western societies since
at least the 1990s. Not only do these innovations upset equilibria of social
power and drive class struggle and upheaval, they also, like the Seleucid
calendar, come to influence the basic precepts, such as time, through which
we view the world.</p>
	<p>To me, an extremely interesting case in point is the <em>ledger</em>, the
technological means by which people record and take stock of transactions of
material resources, property and money. In my opinion, the idea that
accountants are boring people is a great and conspiratorial lie concocted to
obscure the crucial role that this kind of bureaucrat plays in constructing the
very realities in which we live. More than ever, perhaps, in the era of finance
capitalism, the accountant is a great person of history- the strokes of their pen
can consign thousands of lives to privilege or poverty, their machinations and
failures make and cripple nations.</p>
<p>The very first ledgers emerged in Sumer, modern southern Iraq, around
	five and a half millennia ago. The new <em>accounting</em> technology was an
	evolution and abstraction of <em>counting</em> technology. As is explained wonderfully
in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kidWY-pJFb0">video</a>, a technology of quantifying things was developed from the
neolithic onwards whereby one made small models of the thing they were
counting out of clay, an abundant resource in a country which is essentially a
giant floodplain bordered by two great rivers and the ocean. For example, to
record that I owned sixteen goats, I would make sixteen tiny goat
representations, and, thereby, would always know if one went missing. To
track and quantify transactions between people, a small pocket of clay would
be made, and the corresponding number of models would be sealed inside.
That way, if there was a dispute over who owned what to whom, you could
crack open the clay pocket and just count what was inside. Eventually,
someone came up with the bright idea that you didn’t really need this to be a
three dimensional affair- doing away with models and pockets you could just
scratch little pictures of the resource being exchanged into a flat piece of clay.</p>
<p>This was, besides other things, the deep origins of what we now call
writing. Eventually the little drawing of the goat became standardised and
abstracted into a pictograph or ideogram meaning goat. We call this early form
of writing Cuneiform. Over time, these primitive ledgers grew more complex
and systematic as human ingenuity refined the process of their use. Instead of
scratching sixteen goats into the clay, a system developed whereby you just
scratched one, but then punched a number of holes beside it to indicate the
quantity. For trust and transparency it was found that one needed to show the
work of their calculations (so that they could be easily rechecked), and that it
was useful to add dates, signatures and an authenticating stamp or seal.
These basic features became the foundation of trust and exchange within
economic life, and formed the basis of what is recognized as the world’s first
urban culture and civilization.</p>

<p>In his book Debt: The First 5000 Years, the late David Graeber brilliantly
charts the evolutionary downfall of the social currencies that predominate in,

for lack of better terminology, simple societies, into the concepts of money and
quantifiable debt that rule our lives today. Clearly ledger keeping, as it evolved
in Sumer, was a crucial factor within this process. Counting, accounting and
writing, which had been conceived to reflect and keep track of objects- the
material reality around us- came to be seen as somehow more important than
this. The written words and numbers recorded on the ledgers came to be seen
as reality itself, and we began to manipulate matter in the favour of written
words instead of writing to reflect matter. In a textual sense, we can speak of
	ledgers as <em>performative</em> documents- they do not simply reflect and record
facts about reality, but are constituent to reality, the words with which they are
inscribed effect and change reality through their very existence. In a material
culture sense, we can say that ledgers are objects that exercise agency over
human social realities by defining the parameters of what we have or have
not.</p>

<p>While they might have been invented by farmers, ledgers became
particularly crucial to the emergent class of merchants and long distance
traders in the Sumerian world. Whether you were importing cypress wood
from Lebanon, or Ivory from Dilmun, any trading enterprise that was staffed by
more than a single person with exceptional memory required a means to
document and authenticate transactions. Long distance trade of commercial
scale was a new and emerging phenomenon in this period. Merchants’ control
of access to exotic goods and materials was the locus of their increasing
power in a rapidly growing and transforming society. The ledger,
homophonous to the elite soldier’s sword, was the object through which they
projected that power. Similarly, as the soldiers swordplay was the skill and
technique through which they could exercise power, the merchant exercised
theirs through writing.</p>

<p>I believe that a great part of the reason for this has to do with magic.
Magic is a very real force in human relations, despite what unbridled
rationalism might have to say, and it is inherent to our fascination with
technology. It seems to be a natural reaction within humans that we view

technical processes that we don’t understand as magical, and that we attribute
great and incomprehensible power to those who control them. This explains
both our veneration of the artist and the scientist. The brilliant anthropologist
of art, Alfred Gell, said this in an essay;</p>

<img src="roo/b43.jpeg" width="65%"  alt=""/>

	<p><em>“The enchantment of technology is the power that technical processes have of
casting a spell over us so that we see the real world in an enchanted form.”</em></p>



  
  <p>This goes some way to explaining the power that the Sumerian
merchant might have wielded through writing. It’s also highly reminiscent of
the way that financial processes are presented to the public today- as rocket
science that we should not deign to question. If the guy in the suit (or robe as
the case may have been) tells us that that’s what the fancy symbols mean,
then I guess that’s just got to be it.. right?</p>

<p>The power of the ancient merchants represents an early kind of
bureaucracy, a system in which writing and officiating with seals and stamps
comes to dictate reality. This is not to deny the practical utility of the
technologies- if you want to conduct complex economic actions and
transactions you won’t be able to do it without tools of this sort. The ebb and
flow of global trade networks and any other kind of long distance coordination
happens, in part, on the back of innovations in ledger keeping technologies.
This is equally as obvious from the history of double entry book keeping or
modern fiat money as it is with the Cuneiform tablet. So do, however, states,
empires and their incumbent barbarity. Powerful technologies will always have
a relationship to power.</p>

	<p>This brings us to today.
At present it is essentially impossible to avoid the historical ripples (and
predicted ripples) of a new ledger keeping technology- blockchain. Blockchain,
and its manifestation in Cryptocurrencies, has been an absolutely unavoidable
topic of discussion over the past year. I even get regular notifications about it
on my phone these days from a banking app. This hegemonic quality has

existed, in part, because we’ve all been stuck inside, going insane as the
world as we know it appears to end. But that is just a catalyst of the myth
making and enchantment occurring around this new technology, not a cause.
	</p>
	
	<p>I’m not going to try and explain how blockchain works, essentially it
does all the same things earlier ledgers did, but it is now able to authenticate
itself without reference to any central authority- cryptography plays the role of
signature and stamp seal on a Cuneiform tablet. In theory this allows you to
have a decentralized economy, which might or might not be a good thing
		depending on who you ask.<br></br>
		I’m also not going to tell you that blockchain is bad. It’s just a
technology, it’s moral worth is dictated by how it is used and its value by its
usefulness.
</p>

<p>What I am going to suggest is that it hasn’t really proven itself to be very
useful yet for anything other than the reproduction of power. The directional
and organizational capacity of ancient ledger keeping technologies clearly
facilitated and catalysed useful and productive economic activities. Cuneiform
tablets helped Sumerian merchants to import wood, a very useful material,
into Mesopotamia, a region lacking in forests. Ledgers were also key to the
organisation of mass work forces to complete productive economic
improvements such as building irrigation canals and expanding the food base
and population capacity of a society.</p>

<p>Thus far cryptocurrency and blockchain seem to have productive and
commercial function in illicit spaces and blackmarket activities- I’m personally
not so worried about people buying yokes and weed off the dark web but the
reports of hit men and human trafficking are much more odious. Aside from
this it solely seems to function as a highly volatile asset that can be gambled
on, mostly by people who are already powerful and wealthy. What’s more, this
roulette wheel seems pretty clearly rigged when you take notice of the way the
trade value of Crypto seems to swing upward and downward in direct
proportions to the richest guy in the world’s tweets.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s perfectly conceivable that at some point in the future
blockchain technology might find a genuinely useful application, but for now
it’s pretty much smoke and mirrors as far as I can see. Ledger keeping
technologies are clearly a pivotal nexus of human power relations and their
evolution can certainly change the world- but the ideological statements of
libertarian decentralization that seem so attached to the technology’s public
image seem quite stretched to me. If anything, the most likely course of future
events surrounding crypto is that it will help to further embed the same old
aristocracies, maybe with a few new faces thrown in for good measure, into
positions of central power. If history is our guide then we can say that modern
decentralized economies emerge when there’s a civil war or some other
circumstance that effectively forces the state to up stakes and leave. This was
true in Makhnovia in 1920, Spain in 1936 and Rojava today. Ledger keeping
technologies, if they do anything, reproduce centralized power, and I have a
hard time believing that that’s going to be just because of digital lego.</p>
